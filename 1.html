Almost everybody who is politically conscious has strong feelings about one or<br>more of these issues;
but we want you, if you can, <br>to set aside such feelings and consider yourselves only as members of
a biological species which has had a remarkable history,<br>
and whose disappearance none of us can desire. <br><p></p>We shall try to say no 
single word which should appeal to one group rather than to another.<br>
All, equally, are in peril, and, if the peril is understood,<br>
there is hope that they may collectively avert it.<br><br><br>>We have to learn to think in a
new way.<br> We have to learn to ask ourselves, <br>
<img src="asdf.jpg" width="20%"><br>
not what steps can be taken to give military victory to whatever group we prefer, 
for there no longer are such steps; <br><br>
the question we have to ask ourselves is: <br>
what steps can be taken to prevent a military contest of <br>
which the issue must be disastrous to all parties?
